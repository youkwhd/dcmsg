dcmsg
=====

Send messages as a discord bot.

Installation
------------

This blindly assumes that you already have Go installed.

Specify your discord bot token:

    echo "YOUR-DISCORD-BOT-TOKEN" > .TOKEN

There is no support for OTP Tokens at the moment.

You can go to https://discord.com/developers/applications in
order to create a new discord application (bot).

After completing the above instructions, you can run the bot via
a shell script:

    ./dcmsg
